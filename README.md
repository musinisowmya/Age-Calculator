 **Purpose**: The code creates an interactive age calculator that allows users to input their date of birth and calculates their precise age in years, months, and days.

**HTML Structure**: 
   - Defines the layout, including an input field for selecting a date, a button to trigger the calculation, and a section to display the result.

 **CSS Design**: 
   - Uses a visually appealing design with a background image and a transparent card-like calculator.
   - Includes styles for inputs and buttons with hover and focus effects for better user interaction.

 **Responsive Design**: 
   - Ensures the calculator is mobile-friendly by adapting its width on smaller screens.

 **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Implements a `calculateAge()` function to compute the age based on the selected date and the current date.

 **Error Handling**:
   - Validates the input to ensure a valid date is selected and displays an appropriate error message for invalid entries.

 **Age Calculation**:
   - Computes the age by considering the year, month, and day differences.
   - Adjusts the calculation for cases where the current date is before the user's birthday in the same year.

 **Dynamic Result Display**:
   - Displays the calculated age dynamically in a designated result section below the button.

 **Code Quality**:
   - Includes comments in JavaScript for better readability and understanding of the logic.

 **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Provides smooth transitions and animations for user interactions.
   - Uses transparent styling to integrate seamlessly with the background.
