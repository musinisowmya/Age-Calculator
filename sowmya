 **HTML Structure**:
   - Provides the layout for an age calculator with an input field for the birth date, a button to trigger age calculation, and a result display section.

 **CSS Styling**:
   - Applies a clean, visually appealing design with responsive layout.
   - Includes a background image, a transparent white card-style calculator, and hover/focus effects on buttons and input fields for better user interaction.

 **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Captures the selected birth date and calculates the age in years, months, and days by comparing it with the current date.
   - Handles edge cases, like invalid or incomplete input and birthdays that haven't occurred this year.

**Interactivity**:
   - Displays the calculated age dynamically in the result section when the user clicks the "Calculate Age" button.

 **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Ensures the design is responsive for smaller devices and visually blends with the background image.
